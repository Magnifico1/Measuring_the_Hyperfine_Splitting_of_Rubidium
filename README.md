# Measuring the Hyperfine Splitting of Rubidium
Experimental physics investigation of the hyperfine structure of atoms using Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy

The physical phenomenon which we sought to investigate in this three-week project is that of
the hyperfine structure of atoms. This refers to the splitting of an atom’s individual spectral lines
into multiple components as a result of nuclear effects. We investigated the hyperfine structure of
Rubidium-87, specifically that of the 780nm spectral line, using saturated absorption spectroscopy.
This technique was employed due to the undesired effects of Doppler broadening. In addition to
the main experiment, a calibration process was first necessary to determine the relation for time
differences in the PHA output to differences in frequency between the Rubidium atoms’ energy
levels. We then constructed an arrangement to be able to measure the energy dips corresponding
to the atoms’ transition energies. We obtained three energies between the $F = 1$, F = 2, and F = 3
states of 52P 3
2
of 150 ± 20MHz, 260 ± 30MHz, and 410 ± 50MHz respectively. The best estimates
lay within 6% of the literature values and their ranges of uncertainty were in accordance with the
true energies.
